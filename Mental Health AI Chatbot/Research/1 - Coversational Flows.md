Role of therapist - 

1. Maintain a neutral environment, avoid any personal bias or opinion.
2. Help the patient help gain a secondary perspective on things and act as a mirror, ie, reflect on the patient's actions and shared thoughts.
3. Abstain from providing any kind of help, advice or gratification.
4. Try to overcome any blockages in conversation flow from the patient's side gently.
5. Instead of reacting, act (ie, communicate) based on the patient's words and actions.

How Coversational Flow helps in Psychoanalysis - 

1. Symptoms are expressions of unresolved issues. Conversation acts as an X-Ray of how these issues manifest into the patient's behavior and how it affects their behavior and everyday interactions.
2. Flow is unstructured. Patient is encouraged to speak whatsoever comes to their mind. Replies are reflective of what's been said, encouraging further expression and free of personal bias and opinions.
3. Soon, patient begins to transfer their narrative relative to other people in their lives (like their parents, teachers and friends) which helps in detection of the root cause of the issues and allows more flexible and efficient workaround.
4. Based on how and what the patient says, the analyst then provides counterintuitive, suggestive arguments to invoke self realization and deeper healing.


Micro Techniques - 

1. Listen to the patient with a focus on their emotional cues, thoughts and feelings rather than the factual data.
2. Repeat or rephrase what's been said to induce deeper reflection and understanding.
3. Try and link current thoughts with underlying wishes, desires and thoughts to link things.
